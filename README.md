# Image-Classification
Basic image classification using tensorflow
This is my first ever MachineLearning project made with the help of coursera instructions. It makes use of keras with tensorflow as backend and mnist as dataset to make a basic image classifier with an approximate accuracy of 97%. This Trained neural network model can be used to recognize hand written images with minimum loss.
This is a short project which serves the purpose....!
